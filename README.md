# SORBET â€“ Spatial 'Omics Reasoning for Binary Label Tasks

SORBET is a geometric deep-learning framework that utilizes graph-convolutional neural networks (GCN) to classify tissues according to observed phenotypes, such as response to immunotherapy. SORBET classifies tissues directly from spatially-resolved omics measurements (spatial proteomics / transcriptomics). 

The model is broken into a `Learning` phase, where tissues are classified, and a `Reasoning` phase, where the inferred models are analyzed for biological insight. The code shares that structure, with sub-modules for `learning` and `reasoning`. In addition, the code includes a sub-module for `data_handling`.  

## Requirements

SORBET has been tested on Linux 20.04.5 system with CUDA 11.7. 

The package is distributed with a `Dockerfile` for setting up an appropriate environment. Alternatively, the requirements may be installed from the `requirements.txt` file. Note, some packages (primarily the `torch-geometric` stack) must be manually installed after the installation of the packages in the `requirements.txt` file. Please see the `Dockerfile` for additional requirements (lines: 16-21).
